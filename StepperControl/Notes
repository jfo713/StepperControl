initWithCoder: Run in implementation file, what it does?

    Make Information from Implementation file accessible(?) in storyboard

    Anything done in interface - initWithCoder:

Storyboard is xml file; when storyboard fires, decodes xml - will provide better placeholder/preview for injections made in code, useful more complex multi/object viewcontroller; 



    Without initWithCoder:

    i.e. StepperView - everything yesterday, manual code, not exposed/visualized in storyboard...

    initWithCoder -
